GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries.
GraphQL lets clients request exactly the data they need from a server — nothing more, nothing less.

🚀 Why GraphQL?
✓ 1. Fetch only required data

Unlike REST (which often returns fixed data), GraphQL returns only what the client asks for.

✓ 2. Single Endpoint

REST uses multiple endpoints:

/users
/users/:id
/users/:id/posts


GraphQL uses ONE endpoint:

POST /graphql

✓ 3. Strongly Typed Schema

Your API has a schema defining:

Types

Fields

Relationships

Queries

Mutations

✓ 4. Better for complex apps

Works well for:

Mobile apps with bandwidth limitations

Microservices

Frontend-heavy apps (React, Angular, Vue)

🧠 How GraphQL Works?
1. Client sends a query

Example query:

{
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
  }
}

2. Server resolves only requested fields

Response:

{
  "user": {
    "name": "Sumant",
    "email": "sumant@example.com"
  }
}

🛠️ GraphQL Concepts
1. Query

For fetching data (like GET).

2. Mutation

For modifying data (like POST, PUT, DELETE).

3. Schema

Defines your API structure.

4. Resolver

Functions that return the data for each field.

🆚 REST vs GraphQL (Quick Comparison)
Feature	REST	GraphQL
Endpoints	Multiple	One
Data fetching	Fixed	Flexible
Over-fetching	Yes	No
Under-fetching	Yes	No
Schema	No	Strongly typed
Versioning	Often needed	Rarely needed

Why we use GraphQL in Node.js and TypeScript
1. Efficient Data Fetching
With REST, each endpoint returns a fixed structure.
With GraphQL, the client can request exactly the data it needs.

2. Single Endpoint

REST = many URLs ( /users, /users/:id, /products … ).
GraphQL = one endpoint (usually /graphql).

3. Strong Type System (Perfect with TypeScript)

GraphQL has its own schema with strict types:

4. Easy to Integrate With Databases

GraphQL works perfectly with:

PostgreSQL

MongoDB

Prisma ORM

TypeORM

Sequelize

You write resolvers to connect queries/mutations directly to your database.


5. Better for Modern UI Frameworks

Frontend frameworks like:

React

Next.js

Vue

Angular

love GraphQL because clients can fetch exactly what they need.
This greatly improves performance and reduces API calls.


6. Real-Time Support (Subscriptions)

GraphQL supports real-time communication using Subscriptions.

Example:

subscription {
  messageAdded {
    text
    user
  }
}


Perfect for apps like:

Chat applications

Live dashboards

Notifications

7. API Versioning Becomes Easy

With REST you create new versions: /v1/users, /v2/users.
With GraphQL, you simply extend the schema without breaking old clients.

Feature	          REST	                GraphQL
Data fetching	  Fixed	               Flexible
Endpoints	  Many	                 One
Strong typing	  Limited	       Built-in
Real-time	  Complex	       Easy
Versioning	  Hard	               Simple
Works well with TypeScript	Good	Excellent




1. GraphQL ek Query language hai jo precise data fetching allow karta hai 
Sirf wahi data milta hai jo hum chahte hain na zyada , na kam.


2.          REST vs GraphQL
. REST
. -Multiple endpoints
. -Over-fetching/Under-fetching
.- Versioning issues

.GraphQL
. -Single endpoint
. -Exact data fetching
. -No versioning
. Strongly typed Schema

Example Query in GraphQL
{
 user(id: 1)
 name
 posts{
   title
 }
}
}


Real World Use

.GraphQL ko modern companies jaise shopify, GitHub use krte hain
.Frontends jaise React.js/Next.js GraphQL ke sath easily integrate hote hain.



REST API vs GraphQL - Practical Comparison
. Is epicode mein hum GraphQL aur REST API ko practical example ke zariye compare karenge

.Ek hi data ko dono tarike se fetch karenge aur samjhenge kaun better hai.


	API Use Case
. Hume chahiye ek user ka data:

. Name 
. Age
. Uske blog posts ke titles

. Is use case ko hum dono APIs ke through dekhenge
. 1. REST
. 2. GraphQL

	REST API Approach

. GET `/users/1`-> User ka basic data
. GET `/users/1/posts` -> Uske posts

. Multiple requests lagte hain
. Over-fetching ya under-fetching ka chance



		GraphQL Query
{
 use(id:"1") {
 name 
 age
 posts {
  title
 }
}
}

✅Single query
✅Sirf wahi data milta hai jo chahiye

      REST vs GraphQL (Basics)
. REST mein multiple endpoints
. GraphQL mein ek hi endpoint
. REST mein fixed response
. GraphQL mein client defines structure
